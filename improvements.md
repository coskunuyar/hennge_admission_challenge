## Improvements

1.Adding a search input that can accept query options (from:? , to:? , about:? , withAttacment:? ) for advance filtering.Why ? because in existing design most important filtering factor is time.There might be cases where user needs all of the mails that is send from a specific user or mails that is send to a specific user or mails that are about special topic also mails with attachment.

2.Adding pagination for filtered options.Why ? because there will be houndreds of mails that user is filtered.To able to manage them we can use pagination.

3.Adding save button and saved mails section also adding export option as button from this section such as excel or word.Why ? when we apply pagination there might some mails in different pages.Saving mails that looks suspicious and inspecting them in future will be easy.

4.Format of the date section should be same in all cloumns.

5.Implementing more fancy css (colorizing components,box shadows...) Why ? because monolithic and black-grey design reduces the focus of user.
