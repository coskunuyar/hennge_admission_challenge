## Report

Used react for creating components of sample design (such as Table , TableBody , TableHeader,DatePicker...) and management of DOM.

Used Redux to able to manage data through my components.Prefered redux rather than using state of components for the purpose of preventing props drilling , unnecessary rerendering and obtaining single source of truth.Other state management libraries or react-context can be an option.

Used bootstrap-grid to build a responsive design.Building your own grid system (https://github.com/coskunuyar/Responsive-Grid-System-SASS-SCSS) or using plain css flex-box can also be an option.

Created a mock service.Actually just a function that returns dummy data.Building a simple web api can also be an option.
