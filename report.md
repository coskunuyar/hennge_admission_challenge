## Report

Used react for creating components of sample design (such as Table , TableBody , TableHeader,DatePicker...) and managing of DOM.Other SPA frameworks or plain JS also can be an option.

Used Redux to able to manage data through my components.Prefered redux rather than using state of components to prevent props drilling , unnecessary rerendering and obtain single source of truth.Other state management libraries or react-context can be an option.

Used bootstrap-grid to build a responsive design.Building your own grid system (https://github.com/coskunuyar/Responsive-Grid-System-SASS-SCSS) or using plain css flex-box can also be an option.

Created a mock service.Actually just a function that returns dummy data.Building a simple web api can also be an option.
